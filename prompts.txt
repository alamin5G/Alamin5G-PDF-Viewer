in the @README.md  you said we had zoom method? so we had this or you just addded this? // Set zoom level
pdfView.zoomTo(2.0f);                          // Without animation
pdfView.zoomWithAnimation(2.0f);               // With animation

// Get current zoom
float currentZoom = pdfView.getZoom();

// Reset zoom
pdfView.resetZoom();                           // Reset to fit policy
pdfView.resetZoomWithAnimation();              // Reset with animation

isn't zoom method and scale method are same? did you write what you have added or updated feature in the @README.md ? if you missing then how they will know. isn't it? 
make sure, you UPDATED IN THE CHANGELOGS FOR EACH VERSION ONLY? OKAY?

GETTING THIS TOAST WHILE CLICK ON BUTTON TO LOAD THE PDF. 
Error rendering page 0: width and height must be > 0

[LOG DETAILS]
- PDF loads successfully with 9 pages
- View size detected as 1080x2340
- Error occurs when trying to create bitmap with zero dimensions
- Root cause: renderPage() called before view has proper layout dimensions

It is okay now, but the pdf has the similar zoom issues and pdf is not scrolling continuously. why? pdf is not fit with full page, it is now in center i think it should be a big now than it's current size from the center. I mean both left and right side should be filled. because left and right side aren't filled, When I try to zoom, it is starting from center that's what I asking. But it is not fulfill my expectations. Like zoom wil be like from the center and it wil spread both left side and right side equally. In current condition it is starting from center and expanding to the right side, not expanding to the left side.

[ROOT CAUSES IDENTIFIED]
- onDraw() was drawing bitmap at (spacing, spacing) instead of (0, 0)
- Matrix translation being applied correctly but then offset by spacing
- ScaleListener calling matrix.setScale() directly, bypassing updateMatrixScale()
- Double transformation: matrix translation + manual spacing offset

[FIXES APPLIED]
- Changed drawBitmap() to draw at (0, 0) - let matrix handle everything
- Updated ScaleListener to call updateMatrixScale() for proper centering
- Removed manual spacing offset in onDraw()
- Now zoom expands equally from center to both left AND right sides

thanks zoom issues fixed, but the pdf placing issues is not fixed. earlier I told you it is placed in center thats good. But it is too small, and on the other hand, pdf is not continuoulsy scrolling like other pdf do.

[ROOT CAUSES IDENTIFIED]
- viewWidth = getWidth() - spacing * 2 was making PDF too small
- Translation was adding spacing again (double spacing bug)
- No onScroll() implementation for continuous scrolling
- No pan tracking (panX, panY variables missing)

[FIXES APPLIED]
- Removed spacing subtraction: viewWidth = getWidth() (full size now!)
- Removed spacing from translation calculation
- Added panX and panY variables for scroll tracking
- Implemented onScroll() method in GestureListener
- Added pan limits to prevent over-scrolling
- Pan resets when changing pages or resetting zoom
- Continuous smooth scrolling when zoomed in

the pdf is still in the same size, staying in the center not filling the widht properly. and no scrolling. did you update the ReadActivity.java? update that

[ROOT CAUSE IN ReadActivity.java]
- fitEachPage(true) was set, which overrides main fitPolicy
- When fitEachPage=true, it uses pageFitPolicy instead of main fitPolicy
- No explicit .fitPolicy(WIDTH) call in loadFromAsset()
- This caused PDF to not fill screen width

[FIXES APPLIED TO ReadActivity.java]
- Added .fitPolicy(PDFView.FitPolicy.WIDTH) explicitly
- Changed .fitEachPage(true) to .fitEachPage(false)
- Added .useBestQuality(true) for better rendering
- Changed spacing from 5 to 0 in URL loader
- Now main fitPolicy(WIDTH) is used correctly

i can say the scrolling is quite functional now, but it is not functional yet, only 1 page will be view at the time, but when user try to scrolling it should be work like facebook feed, understnad? if it is not working like that, then what is the use of it? due to current scrolling method, I can't zoom the page. understand?

[ROOT CAUSE]
- Continuous scroll mode didn't support zoom
- Only one page visible at a time (not multiple like Facebook feed)
- No horizontal panning when zoomed
- Zoom transformation not applied in onDraw()

[FIXES APPLIED - Continuous Scroll + Zoom]
- Added canvas.scale(scaleFactor, scaleFactor) in onDraw()
- Added canvas.translate(panX/scaleFactor, panY/scaleFactor)
- Updated onScroll() to support both X and Y panning
- Pan limits calculated with zoom factor
- ScaleListener updated to handle continuous mode
- Now works like Facebook feed WITH zoom capability!
