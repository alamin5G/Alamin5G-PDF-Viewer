in the @README.md  you said we had zoom method? so we had this or you just addded this? // Set zoom level
pdfView.zoomTo(2.0f);                          // Without animation
pdfView.zoomWithAnimation(2.0f);               // With animation

// Get current zoom
float currentZoom = pdfView.getZoom();

// Reset zoom
pdfView.resetZoom();                           // Reset to fit policy
pdfView.resetZoomWithAnimation();              // Reset with animation

isn't zoom method and scale method are same? did you write what you have added or updated feature in the @README.md ? if you missing then how they will know. isn't it? 
make sure, you UPDATED IN THE CHANGELOGS FOR EACH VERSION ONLY? OKAY?
